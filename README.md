# Minimal Dnn theme

## Getting started
1. **Important**: This is a template repository. If you intend to contribute, please use the `Fork` button. If you intend to build a theme using this as a template, please use the `Use this template` button.

2. Clone the repository to the `Portals\_default` folder of a working Dnn site.
3. Navigate to the created folder.
4. You will need `npm` if you do not have it installed yet, please visit [the node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
5. In the command line, run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies.

## Customizing your theme
To customize your theme to your needs, run `npm run settings` and answer a couple of questions.

## Development
The build scripts have a live-server proxy that will automatically rebuild upon any file change and reload your browser. This is quite useful for rapid development but has limitations, such as not being able to use the persona bar using the proxy.

1. Run `npm run watch`.
2. When asked, enter the URL of the site you would normally visit.
3. That site will be proxied as http://localhost:3000 and will live-reload upon any file change.

If you run into cache issues and do not see your changes immediately, disable Dnn cache/bundling/minification settings, and keep your development panel open. To give Dnn time to realize changes, we need to inject a 1-second delay to the reload. If you need more or less delay, it can be adjusted in the `reloadDelay` option of the `browserSync` options. BrowserSync also allows you to view the site in your local network on multiple devices at once and will reload them all! All other BrowserSync options are supported, read [BrowerSync Documentation](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/options) for more details.

## Versioning
This project uses GitVersion to automatically update versions using the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) release management workflow. In summary, the `develop` branch is the one where development happens most of the time for the next minor release. Creating a `release/x.x.x` branch will trigger a beta build and create an unpublished pre-release with version `x.x.x`. Merging the `release/x/x/x` branch into the `main` branch will trigger another build that will create an official (non-beta) release for version `x.x.x`. For each of those releases, the release notes will be automatically generated from pull requests that were merged with a milestone of the same version. Those release notes are also grouped by the labels used.

## Javascript utilities
In the `src/scripts/utilities` you will find some useful utilities you can opt into, right now those utilities are:
* `replaceClasses` which takes a list of old>new classes, replaces them in content and optionally logs that replacement in the browser console.
* There is also a `migrateFa4ToFa5` function that replaces all deprecated FontAwesome4 classes to their best lookalike in FontAwesome5 using the previous `replaceClasses` function. To opt-in to this feature, add the following snipped in the `main.ts` file:
```ts
import { migrateFa4ToFa5 } from './utilities/utils';

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    migrateFa4ToFa5();
});
```
